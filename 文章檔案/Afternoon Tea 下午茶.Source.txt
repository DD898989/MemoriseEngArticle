I love drinking tea, and knowing this 精於此道. A friend once invited me to a teahouse where we had one of my favourite types of tea : oolong. During the conversation my friend told me that his whole family liked to drink tea, especially his mother : " She really likes to drink thick tea. " It took me a while to figure out his meaning, but eventually I realized that what he meant to say was " 她喜歡喝濃茶 ". Which in English would be " She likes to drink really strong tea. "
