邀請女孩子外出是我感覺最緊張的一件事。
The thing that makes me most nervous is asking girls out for dates.

這種可怕的煩惱是在我高二那年開始的，當時我開始對女孩子發生興趣。
I began to have this terrible anxiety when I became interested in girls in my second year of high school.

我常常怕女孩子會拒絕我的邀請。
I am always afraid that the girl will say no.

這種恐懼對我有不良的影響。
This crazy fear has had a bad effect on me.  

因為怕遭到拒絕而我有時無法安心讀書。
I worry about it so much that I sometimes have a hard time studying.  

我真希望女孩子必須邀請男孩子，而不是像現在必須由男孩主動。
I. often wish girls had to ask boys out instead of the way it is!  

我希望有一天，我的煩腦會消失。如果不能，我將永遠不會有女朋友。
I ,hope I can get rid of my anxiety someday or I'll never get a girlfriend.
