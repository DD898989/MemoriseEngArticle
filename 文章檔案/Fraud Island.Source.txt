這幾年，問到台灣人最差的共同經驗為何，
These past few years, if you ask Taiwanese people what their worst collective experience has been, 

大家都會說“ 「詐騙電話」！而詐騙集團靠著隨機打電話，「亂槍打烏：，也 成為台灣最賺錢的行業之一！ 
people will reply: "Telephone fraud!" Fraudulent companies have utilized random calls, or so-called "reckless shooting," to create one of Taiwan's most profitable industries! 

在台灣，幾乎沒有人沒接過詐騙電話。
There is hardly anyone in Taiwan who has not received a single scamming phone call. 

從早期的通知民眾 中獎·退稅，
Beginning with earlier rackets of informing individuals they have won a prize or received a tax return, 

之後的偽稱信用卡被盜刷、親友急難·假綁架等陰謀，
to later schemes of faking credit card theft, posing as friends or relatives in need, or faking kidnappings, 

到現在的偽裝成司法機構，
to the latest tactic of pretending to be a judicial institution, 

台灣詐騙電話的花招之多·創意 之豐富，以及「國際化」的速度之快·
Taiwanese telephone fraud has exhibited a vast repertoire of maneuvers, an abundance of creativity, and a world-class speed of "internationalization." 

簡直可以列入金氏世界紀錄！ 
This type of fraud is really worthy of mention in the Guinness Book of World Records! 

可憐的台灣人，現在只要聽到電話鈴聲就會以為是詐騙電 話，
Poor Taiwanese are now reminded of telephone fraud each time their phone rings, 

沒有「來電顯示」的電話更不敢接。
and afraid of picking up any calls that do not show up on caller ID. 

大家越來越難判斷事情 的真實性。
In addition, it is becoming harder for people to judge the truthfulness of anything. 

人們如何確定是否接到的贖金電話或者何時可以真 的去領獎？
How can people be sure they have really received a call for ransom or when they can claim a prize they have rightfully won? 

更慘的是，有時民眾明明知道是詐‘騙電話，卻還不能 向對方罵「三字經」，
Even more tragic is when people are certain that the call is fraudulent and still have to keep themselves from blurting out any four-letter words. 

因為若如此，隔天可能就會收到一拖拉庫 不請自來的披薩。嗚呼哀哉！ 
The reason is that if they let themselves go, alas, they might just receive a truckload of unordered pizza at their doorstep the very next day!
