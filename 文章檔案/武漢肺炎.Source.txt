病毒家族有許多成員，其中冠狀病毒往往會引起呼吸道感染
There are many members of the virus family, but coronaviruses tend to cause respiratory infections, 

從典型感染（例如普通感冒）到更嚴重的感染（例如 ＳＡＲＳ 和 ＭＥＲＳ）
from typical ones such as the common cold to more serious ones such as SARS and MERS.

專家建議近期避免前往中國，尤其是武漢。
Experts advise that you should avoid traveling to China, especially Wuhan, in the near future. 

勤洗手，勿觸摸臉部或揉眼睛。
Wash your hands frequently. Do not touch your nose and mouth or rub your eyes. 

在人多擁擠的地方和長途運輸工具（例如火車或飛機）上配戴口罩。
Wear a surgical mask in crowded places and on long-distance transportation, such as trains or planes.

根據研究，外科口罩在預防流感病毒傳播方面相當有效。
According to research, surgical masks are quite effective in preventing the spread of influenza viruses. 

即使是醫護人員，也都是戴外科口罩照顧流感病人。
Even medical personnel wear surgical masks when they treat influenza patients. 

而適逢農曆過年假期，口罩製造商暫停了生產，
However, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, mask manufacturers paused production, 

導致許多人反映他們根本買不到口罩。
leading many people to report that they cannot buy masks at all. 

回應此現象，政府宣佈在過去三天中每天釋出六百萬個口罩。
In response, the government announced that 6 million masks have been released each of the last 3 days. 

由於緊急情況，每人限購三個口罩。

希望民眾不要驚慌，不要囤積過多的口罩。
