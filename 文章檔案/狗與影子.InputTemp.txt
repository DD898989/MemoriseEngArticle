i h;ed t a dog had got a piece of meat  and  w carrying it home in his mouth

n o h w h h h to cross a plank lying across a running brook

a h crossed

h looked down a s his own shadow reflected in the water beneath

thinking i w a d w another piece of meat


h made up his mind to have that also

s h made a snap at the shadow in the water

but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out 

d;pped into the water and was never seen more
