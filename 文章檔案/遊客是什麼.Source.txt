What Is a Tourist Like?

By coach, by train, by ship, and by plane, millions of tourists depart from home like migrating birds.  They are the very evidence to prove that the world is not as big as it used to be. 

坐公車、坐火車、坐船、坐飛機，數以百萬計的觀光客像候鳥一樣離家出發。他們是活的證據，證明世界沒以前那麼大了。

 He ventures forth into the unknown and returns home in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, he is armed with pamphlets, maps, and weighty guidebooks.

Travel-worn, the tourist eventually arrives home proudly displaying his collection of passport-stamps.

旅行累了，觀光客終於回到了家裡，驕傲地展示他護照上蓋的一大堆印記。
