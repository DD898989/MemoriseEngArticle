One time I remember talking to a parent, whose son I was teaching English to. I asked the parent why his son was enrolled in so many classes and he replied, "I want my son to become a dragon." I couldn't understand his meaning. When I asked a Chinese friend with good English I understood that his meaning had been 望子成龍, which in English would be better expressed as "I have high hopes for my son."
