一只狗嘴里衔着一块肉，
It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth.

走过一条河上面的桥，
Now, on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook. As he crossed, 

看见他自己在水里的影子，
he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath. 

以为是另一只狗，那时狗衔着的肉，
Thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat, 

她也想要
he made up his mind to have that also. 

狠狠地扑向那只狗，
So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, 

结果两头都落了空，
but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out,

而原来的那一块，也被水冲走了。
dropped into the water and was never seen more.
